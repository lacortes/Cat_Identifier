    <string name="test_breed_info">Maine Coons are highly intelligent, calm, and people-oriented cats.
        This breed gets along well with children and other pets. Some follow their owners around the house and may even
        enjoy playing with water or playing fetch. Maine Coons make great companions for first-time cat owners, singles,
        families, and those with other pets. Understanding their unique needs will help keep them healthy and create a
        strong bond between the two of you.</string>
